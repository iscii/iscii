Good morning 🐇    
I'm Issac! I currently attend Stevens Institute of Technology and study Computer Science. I enjoy music, exploring, and the little things; related to my position, problem solving and a solid challenge. I'm looking for work in a warm, ever-improving environment driven by a shared goal where I could palpably reap the rewards of my years of work and make a difference.
